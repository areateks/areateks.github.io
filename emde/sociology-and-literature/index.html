        <h1 class="notranslate" translate="no">I Introduction: Sociology and Literature</h1>
<p>1</p>
<p>For the literary critic literature is seen as a largelyself-enclosed, self-sustaining enterprise. Works of literature must beapproached primarily in terms of their own inner structure,  imagery, metaphor, rhythm, delineation Ofcharacter, dynamics of plot, and so on. Only occasionally is the externalsociety allowed to intrude and then merely descriptively, as a necessarybackground. The modern literary critic, absorbed as he is inwholly textual criticism, in the intrinsic qualities ofliterature,would almost certainly be hostile to any claim that hissubjectcould be illuminated by an approach which would be largelyextrinsic. To suggest that sociology (defining it for themomentas one example of the extrinsic approach) would not merelycastlight on certain literary problems, but that without itthere couldnot be a complete understanding of literature — such a viewwould be rejected, and with feeling. After all, as theliterarycritic would doubtless point out, the study of literatureand thestudy ofsociety imply wholly different methods andorientations.What possible bridge can there be between the worlds ofimagination and science?</p>
<p>These objections should not deter the prospective literarysociologist. At the most basic level, that of content,sociology andliterature share a similar conspectus. Sgciology isessentially thescientific, objective study of man in society, the study ofswialinstituti)ns and of social processes; it seeks to answer thequestion of how society is possible, how it works, why it persists.Through a rigorous examination of the social institutions,religious, economic, political, and familial, which togetherconstitute what is called social Structure, a picture emerges, not alwaysclearly, of the ways in which man adapts to and is conditioned by particularsocieties; or the mechanisms of 'social-ization the process of cultural learning, wherebyindividualsare allocated to and accept their respective roles in thesocialstructure.* This aspect of sociology is related to theconcept Ofsocial stability, of continuity within different societies,the 'Faysin which individuals come to accept the major socialinstitutionsas both necessary and right. But, of course, sociology isconcerned also with the processes whereby society changes, gradually, orcataclysmically as in revolution, from one type of societyto another — from feudalism to capitalism for example — andtheeffects which these changes have on social structure. Socialprocesses also refer to small-scale internal change: the means, rorexample, whereby social and political authority are'legitimized', that is, come to be accepted ag right by the majority ofthe population; The ways in which conflict between classes,between groups, or simply between individuals is eithersuccessfully or unsuccessfully regulated by social institutions,allowing some form of consensus to bc achieved.</p>
<p>As with sociology, literature too is pre-eminently concernedwith man's social world, his adaptation to it, and hisdesire tochange it. Thus the novel, as the major literary genre ofindustrial society, can be seen as a faithful attempt to re-create thesocial world of man's relation with his family, withpolitics, withthe State; it delineates too his roles within the family andotherinstitutions, the conflicts and tensions between groups andsocial classes. In the purely documentary sense, one can seethenovel as dealing with much the same social, economic, andpolitical textures as sociology. But of course it achievesmorethan this; as art, literature transcends mere descriptionandobjective scientific analysis, penetrating rhe surfaces ofsociallife, showing the ways in which men and women experience societyas feeling. 'Without the full literary witness,' writesRichard Hoggart, 'the student of society will be blind tothefullness of a society.'*</p>
<p>Although, then, it would seem that literature and sociologyarc not wholly distinct disciplines but, on the contrary,complement each other in our understanding of society, historicallythey have tended to remain apart. Early sociologists, suchasComte and Spencer in the nineteenth century and Durkheimand Weber in the twentieth, while making the occasionalreference to imaginative literature, on the whole subordinated it tothe study of social structure. Thc soctological study oflitcraturcis thus a fairly late arrival, for although there are todaywelldeveloped sociologies of religion, education, politics,socialchange, even of such an imprecisc area as ideology, there isvirtually no established corpus of knowledge called the sociology ofis also unfortunate that the small amount of knowledge andresearch which docs exist is on the whole exceedinglydubious in quality, lacking in scientific r'gour, banal inthequality of its sociological insights ' , and frequentlyconsisting ofthe crudest correlations between literary texts and socialhistory.</p>
<p>At the present time it is possible to characterize two broadapproaches to a sociology of literature. The most popularpe:-spective adopts the documentary aspect of literature,arguingthat it provides a mirror to the age. This mirror imageapproachhas a long and distinguished history: the French philosopherLouis de Donald (1754—1840) was one of the first writers toargue that through a careful reading of any nation'sliterature'one could tell what this people had been ' , whileStendhal, in acelebrated passage in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Le Rouge et le Noir</em>, wrote ofthe novel asa'mirror journeying down the high road ' , sometimesreflecting'the azure blue of heaven, sometimes the mire in thepuddles'.On this view literature is a direct reflection of variousfacets ofsocial structure, family relationships, class conflict, andpossiblydivorce trends and population composition. As one of themore distinguished writers in the sociology of literaturehaswell it: 'It is the task of the sociologist of literature torelate the experience of the writer's imaginary charactersandsituations to the historical climate from which they derive.Hehas to transform the private equation of themes andstylisticmeans into social equations.'*</p>
<p>This 'transforming' of the private world of literature tospecific social meanings, the extrinsic approach toliterature, hasfrequently come under severe criticism. It is argued againstit,for example, that the method tends to use literature solelyas aquarry of information to be sociologically 'ransacked'; thatliterature is being 'turned over from the outside' by thoselacking the necessary critical apparatus for understanding andevaluation. Implicit too in this method is the danger thattheliterary sociologist might not have sufficient skill tounravel thehistorical details of particular periods. After all, sincethe literarydocument has to be analyged in terms of the world itsupposedlyrepresents, then only a person who has knowledge of thestruc-ture of a society from other sources than purely literaryones isable to find out if, and how far, certain socicl types andtheirbehaviour are reproduced in a novel in an adequate orinadequate manner'. But the real problem arises overthe question of what literature actually reflects. If thenovel, forexample, is the mirror of an age, then this raises thequestion ofwhether or not purely literary devices may this portrayal;too often in the past an artistic fidelity to historical andsocialtruth has been assumed, with wholly disastrousinterpretativeConsequences. There is, too, the question of generalization:to what extent are the fictional characters and situationstypicalOf a specific historical period? Can any sociologicalgeneralizations bc drawn — for example, frcm the novels ofCharles Dickens and Mrs Gaskell — on such social issues asnineteenth-century management—labour relations, the role oftrade unions or working-class consciousness? What usefulsociological material is there in the Victorian novelist'sconception of the English working class, which is not far moreaccurately conveyed from a close reading of contemporaryjournals, factory reports, government inquiries, crudehealth,and mortality statistics? And these latter sources are freeto avery great extent from the Victorian novelists' middle-classperspectives and ideology.</p>
<p>The conception or the mirror, then, must bc treated withgreat care in the sociological analysis of litemture. Aboveallelse, of course, it ignores the writer himself, hisawareness andintention. Great writers do not set out simply to depict thesocial world in largely descriptive terms; it might besuggestedthat the writer by definition has a more critical task, ofsettinghis characters in motion within artificially contrivedsituationsto seek their own private destiny' , to discover values andmeaning in the social world. For society is more than an ensemble ofsocial institutions that make up social structure: itcontains bothnorms, the standards of behaviour which individuals come toaccept as right ways of acting and judging, as well asvalues whicharc consciously formulated and which people strive torealizesocially. Literature clearly reflects norms, attitudes tosex by theworking clas and middle clas, for example; it reflects, too,values in the sense of the writer's own intention, and itmight besuggested that it is on the level Of values where literatureis Seento reinforce and illuminate purely sociological material.This isparticularly noticeable in literature which chooses itselfas subject. Thus although both Balzac in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Lost Illusions</em> and GeorgeGissing in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">New Grab Street</em> (1891) provide a fairlyaccuratepicture of the increasing commercialization of literatureduringthe nineteenth century, the novelists' real aim lies moreproperly within the realm of The essential theme of bothnovels is the conflict between the genuine literaryconsciousnesOf poet and novelist on the one hand and the practical,whollycalculative and mercenary dictates of the industrializedliterarymarket on the other — the tension between literature as artandliterature as trade. Both Balzac and Gissing are usingspecifichistorical features of the nineteenth century as thebackgroundfor their main theme: the devaluation of values, thesacrifice of artist on the altar of profit. It could be argued, then, that the' true ' meaning of great literature and the social groupsinvolvedin its production lies precisely in the quest and thestruggle ofboth for authentic valucs', thc values of a genuine humancommunity in which human needs, aspirations, and desires aremediated through social interaction. If this is so, and itwillbe defended later in the book, then:the task of thesociologist isnot simply to historic" and social reflection (orrefraclion) in works of literature, but to articulatc the nature of thevalues embedded within particular literary works what Ray-mond Williams has called 'the structure of feeling'.* "ThususLowenthal has suggested that the main purpose of any viableof literature must be to discover the core of meaning'which one finds at the heart of different works ofliterature andwhich expresses many aspects of thought and feeling onsubjectsas varied as social clxss, work, love, religion, nature, andart.In his own work Lowenthal shows how Cervantes' hero DonQuixote can be understood sociologically as a structure ofsentiments and behaviour indicative of 'extreme personal insecurity' whichranges from fears of starvation and loss of socialstatus to philosophical uncertainty. Such sentiments, heargues,can be seen as a direct result of the rapid increase insocialmobility which followed the decline of Spanish feudalismwithits stress on fixed social position, Ind the development ofamuch more fluid and open commercial society in which, socialstatus depended more on achievement than on ascription. DonQuixote is thus scen as an essentially isolated individualdominated by an apprehensive rather than optimistic view of theworld.t For Lowenthal, this kind of analysis will succeed inrevealing thc Sccntral problems with which man has been con-cerned at various times, permitting us to develop an imagcof agiven society in terms or the individuals who composed it'.Welearn both of the nature of society and the ways individualsexperienced it, thmugh the fictional characters who see andrecord 'not only the reality around them, but their hopes,wishes, dreams and fantasies The social meanings of thisinner life of characters, Lovcnthal concludes, are relatedtoproblems of social change. Thus literature, as a reflectionofvalues and of feeling, points both to the degrcc of changeoccurring in different societies as well x'; to the manner in which individualsbecomc socialized into the social structure and theirresponse to this experience. Literature, because it delineatesman's anxieties, hopes, and aspirations, is perhaps one ofthcmost effective sociologieal barometers of the human responsetosocial forces. It has to he said, however, rhat whileliterature willreflect social values and feelings in the way that Lowenthalhasargued, it is highly probable that as society grows morecomplexin its modes of socialization, change, and social structure,it willbecome increasingly difficult to analyse literature solelyin termsof reflection. In the eighteenth century it was stillpossible forFielding in <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Tom Jones</em>.' to portray a whole society, atotality, interms of its values and fcclings through his rich gallery ofcharacters; as, indeed, bad Homer living in a more homogeneous andsmaller society. But with the beginnings ofindustrialization and'he development of a complex social structure involving amultiplicity of class and status positions, together with thc growth ofmass communications and the so-called mass society, 'no onecould possibly attempt anything along the stmc lines if onlyhecausc no single individual can have personal knowledge ofmore than minute fraction of it' If the novel, whosc riseparallels the cmcrgcncc of industrial society, reflectssocial structure, then it has done so in portraying the problems of societyin gcneral in terms of a restricted milieu which functionsas asocial microcosm: Balzac's nobles, bourgeoisie, and artists,Prousl's decaying aristocracy, Aldous Huxley's upper-clasintellectuals, reflect the particular historical crisis ofsociety ingeneral. </p>
<p>The second approach to a literary sociology moves away fromthe emphasis on the work of literaturc itself to theproductionside, and especially to the social situation of thc writer.A leadingauthority in this field, the French sociologist RobertEscarpit,has tended to concentrate exclusively on this aspect.tPatronageand the costs of production replace the literary text as thecentreof discussion. Thus the writer's relationship with hisoften oblique and unsavoury, is traced in some detail, fromthepatronage of the medieval courts to that of theeighteenth-century aristocracy. With the rise of cheap publishing and amass market the patronage system gives way to the autocracyof the publisher and booksellers. The growth, too, of aspecifically middle-class audience in the late eighteenth centuryhelped to shift the writer's position fmm one of dependcncctoone of profession. This gradual democratization of culture,asthe German sociologist Karl Mannheim has called it, is especiallysignificant for the rise of the novel, a pre—eminently middle-class literarygenre, and the emergence of modern sensibilityor modern psychology. The cultural triumph of the middleclasses can be seen as foreshadowing mass culture and thevir-tual commercialization of literature. "The writer's position in amass society is extremely important as a contrast to hisearliersocial situation, and clearly likely to affect his creativepotentialin many ways; the links between this historical backgroundandthe development of literature constitute a key area in anyliter—ary sociology. It involves a major problem, namely thepreciselinkage between the text and its background — how doliteraryproduction and consumption affect the form and the contentofparticular literary works? It must be noted, however, thatalthough this approach is essential for any thoroughunderstand-ing of literature, as crucial support for textual analysis,greatcare has to be exercised in order to avoid the extremelycrudeforms of reductionism obviously inherent in it. The work ofliterature must never become a mere epiphenomenon of itssurrounding environment.A persistent theme of this particular sociological approachisthe emphasis on the increasing alienation of the writer fromhissociety and the consequent impact on literary style andcontent.This social fragmentation has frequently been traced to thedecline of patronage in the late eighteenth century and the writer'scmcrgencc as a member of a 'free floating intelligentsia'.*Inpre-industrial society, it is argued, a relative harmonyexistedbetween the author and his audience; in Periclean Athens,Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides were more or less integratedinto society and not regarded as members of a separateclass, In Augustan Rome, on the other hand, theglorification ofthe regime by Horace and Virgil can be seen as a directresultof the system or patronage.* With the decline of Rome andAthens courtly patronage became the writer's main support,for example, in Renaissance Italy and in seventeenth- andeighteenth-century France; patronage of the Court was thenfrequently followed by that of rhe rich, with needy authorsvyingwith each other for food and money. Patronage and thelimitedaudience of pre-industrial and early commercial societyclearlyconditioned the writer's response: there existed between theauthor and his audience a congruence of values, of mutualunderstanding. But with the rise of a specificallymiddle—classreading public, lending libraries, and cheap publishing,writerswere forced more and more to depend on thc system ofroyaltiesfor their living: literature, as already observed, turnedinto atrade. For the genuine creative writer the late nineteenthandearly years of the twentieth century completed hisalienationfrom society and strengthened his identification withlargelyintellectual groups. The point which divides the period whenitwas still possible for the writer to identify with themiddle classand express its values through literature, pre—eminentlysocialand rational, from the period of doubt and uncertainty withitsemphasis on the psychological and subjectivist state, hasoftenbeen cited as the year of revolutions — 1848 — when Europewasconvulsed with conflict. After this date, in most WesternEuropean countries the middle class had either attained politicalpower or were in the process of doing so. The creativewriter,with his critical function turned in now on the class fromwhichhe usually derived both his paternity and income, becomes'problematic'.</p>
<p>These, then, are two of the major orientations to thescriological study of literature, rhe one buttressing the other in termsof total understanding. But, as with many subjects, aperniciousdivision of labour hag tended to separatc them so thatresearcheither concentrates on the social context of writing or ontheliterary text and its social meaning'. Those sociologistswhosestarting point is the text frequently regard the socialprerequisitces of writing ag largely irrelevant for a literary sociology. ThusLucien Goldmann has argued that in the case of great writers(and for him these are the only writers worthy of study) thepurely sociological conditions or writing arc surmounted andtranscended so that the Incanings within the texts arcunrelatedto the market conditions ofauthorship. He suggests rhatsecond-rate writers can bc defined precisely as those who do notsuccced in freeing themselves from the dictates of the social—economic context, so that sociological conditions penetratetheirwork, dominating its Structure and content and giving it apurely temporal significance. Goldmann's point iscontentious:most eighteenth- and nineteenth-century authors wrote for aspecific audience, creating character and incident thatwouldconform with its values, especially thc attitudes towardssex.In both Dickens and Balzac the structure of the novelshinges onthe requirements of serial publication, and Balzac'speculiarlydramatic elements (criminal characters, sudden and violentdénouements) are obviously connected to the development ofFrench magazine-publishing in the 1830s and rhe 1840s.Gold-mann's point is probably more apposite in the case of modernliterature. Great writers no longer publish in serial form,thisbeing mainly the prerogative of the second-rate and pulpwriters. More significantly, it has now become exccedinglydifhcult to connect the audience, publisher, social groupnexuswith great literature in any meaningful way. Is it at allpossible,for example, to connect sociologically Virginia Woolf'sstreamof consciousness writing technique with the general socialconditions of authorship prevailing in the early twentieth centuryIs it not rather a question, as Goldmann insists, of tracingdlrough the linkages between the writer's social groupaffiliations and connecting both their structure and values with theliterary texts? The publisher-author-audience relationshipisthus, on this view at least, no longer sociologicallydeterminate.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>While the study of literature as a form of social reflectionaswell as its study in terms of the social context ofauthorship constitute the two major modes of study, they exhaustthe sociological approach. A third perspective, onedemandinga high level of skills, attempts to trace the ways in whicha workof literature is actually received by a particular societyat aspecific historical moment. Thus Guy de Maupassant'sliteraryreception in England during the 1880s and the 1890s helpedtoeffect the transition from an English literature penetratedby anaive or oblique sexuality to one distinctly modern inoutlook.In the novels or Thomas Hardy and George Moore, for example,sex is treated more directly than in the novels of Dickensand George Eliot, and this change serves to illustrate theconflictof values, in late Victorian England, between thetraditionalliterary practitioners and the innovators. * Lowenthal hasshownhow ill Germany between 1880 and 1920 the middle and upperclasses successfully assimilated Doestoevsky into their ownpeculiar ideology. The dominant theme ill German literarycriticism, Lowenthal's main source, in this period was anemphasis on lhstoevsky's irrationalism, which Lowenthal suggestsis connected with the rapid contemporary growth of bigbusinessand a fully capitalist society.t If giant economic andpoliticalstructures were to be accepted by the people, the ideal ofcompetition among men through the development of reason and willhad to be replaced by a veneration of non-rational idealsremoved from the forum of critical verification.' To the Germancritics Dostoevsky appeared as anti-intellectual, mystical,other-worldly, and implacably hostile to the ideas of socialism;hisnovels could be used as 'intellectual weapons againstefforts toreorganize society' such as those proposed by Germansocialism. This reception of Dostoevsky, Lowenthal suggests, illuscrates theprofound crisis of consciousness which afflicted theGerman nation during these forty years and which was to culminatein the extreme irrationalism, anti-intellectualism, andanti-socialism of the Nazis.</p>
<p>Lowenthal's choice of Dostoevsky points to a problem we havenot yet really touched upon: the choice of writer for studyandanalysis! It is interesting to note that on this point mostsociologists of literattre and literary critics are agreed: one studiesgreat writers and their texts precisely because theirgreatnessimplies deep insights into the human and the socialcondition.Thus for Leo Lowenthal, the artist 'portrays what is morerealthan reality itself', while for Richard Hoggart, greatliteraturepenetrates more deeply into human experience because it hastheCapacity 'to see not only individual instances but deeperandmore long-term movements below the surfacc detail' land theability 'to unite dissimilars, to reveal a pattern out of amass anda mess, like a magnet placed into iron filings'.* The greatartistportrays 'the widely man in depth '.</p>
<p>The problem of choice cannot be resolved here but it clearlyinvolves the question of criteria; and the specificcriterionseems here to simply that of persistence, that greatliteraturesurvives.
