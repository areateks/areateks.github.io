        <h1 class="notranslate" translate="no">LITERATURE AND SOCIETY</h1>
        <p><strong>Literature</strong> is a social institution, using as itsmedium language, asocial creation. Such traditional literary devices assymbolism andmetre are social in their very nature. They are conventionsand normswhich could have arisen only in society. But, furthermore,literature‘ represents* ‘ life*; and ‘ life* is, in large measure, asocial reality, eventhough the natural world and the inner or subjective worldof the individualhave also been objects of literary ‘ imitation*. The poethimself isa member of society, possessed of a specific social status:he receivessome degree of social recognition and reward; he addressesan audience,however hypothetical. Indeed, literature has usually arisenin closeconnexion with particular social institutions; and inprimitive societywe may even be unable to distinguish poetry from ritual,magic, wotk,or play. Literature has also a social function, or ‘ use*,which cannot bepurely individual. Thus a large majority of the questionsraised byliterary study are, at least ultimately or by implication,social questions:questions of tradition and convention, norms and genres,symbols andmyths. With Tomars, one can formulate:</p>
        <p><strong>Esthetic institutions are not based upon socialinstitutions: they are not even part o f social institutions: they are socialinstitutions o f one type and intimately interconnected with those others</strong>.1</p>
        <p>Usually, however, the inquiry concerning ‘ literature andsociety* isput more narrowly and externally. Questions are asked aboutthe relationsof literature to a given social situation, to an economic,social, andpolitical system. Attempts are made to describe and definethe influenceof society on literature and to prescribe and judge theposition of literaturein society. This sociological approach to literature isparticularlycultivated by those who profess a specific socialphilosophy. Marxistcritics not only study these relations between literatureand society,but also have their clearly defined conception of what theserelationsshould be, both in our present society and in a future ‘classless * society.They practise evaluative, ‘ judicial* criticism, based onnon-literarypolitical and ethical criteria. They tell us not only whatwere and arethe social relations and implications of an author’s workbut whatthey should have been or ought to be.2 They are not onlystudentsof literature and society but prophets of the future,monitors, propagandists;and they have difficulty in keeping these two functionsseparate.</p>
        <p>The relation between literature and society is usuallydiscussed bystarting with the phrase, derived from De Bonald, that ‘literature is anexpression of society’. But what does this axiom mean? If itassumesthat literature, at any given time, mirrors the currentsocial situation‘ correctly’, it is false; it is commonplace, trite, andvague if it meansonly that literature depicts some aspects of socialreality.3 To say thatliterature mirrors or expresses life is even more ambiguous.A writerinevitably expresses his experience and total conception oflife; but itwould be manifestly untrue to say that he expresses thewhole of life -or even the whole life of a given time - completely andexhaustively.It is a specific evaluative criterion to say that an authorshould expressthe life of his own time fully, that he should be ‘representative* of hisage and society. Besides, of course, the terms ‘ fully’ and‘ representative*require much interpretation: in most social criticism theyseem to meanthat an author should be aware of specific socialsituations, e.g. of theplight of the proletariat, or even that he should share aspecific attitudeand ideology of the critic.</p>
        <p>In Hegelian criticism and in that of Taine, historical orsocial greatnessis simply equated with artistic greatness. The artistconveys truthand, necessarily, also historical and social truths. Worksof art furnish‘ documents <em class="notranslate" translate="no">because</em> they are monuments’.4 A harmonybetween geniusand age is postulated. ‘ Representativeness*, ‘ socialtruth’, is, by definition,both a result and cause of artistic value. Mediocre, averageworksof art, though they may seem to a modern sociologist bettersocial documents,are to Taine unexpressive and hence unrepresentative.Literatureis really not a reflection of the social process, but theessence, theabridgement and summary of all history.</p>
        <p>But it seems best to postpone the problem of evaluativecriticism tillwe have disengaged the actual relations between literatureand society.These descriptive (as distinct from normative) relationsadmit of ratherready classification.</p>
        <p>First, there is the sociology of the writer and theprofession andinstitutions of literature, the whole question of theeconomic basis ofliterary production, the social provenance and status of thewriter, hissocial ideology, which may find expression in extra-literarypronouncementsand activities. Then there is the problem of the socialcontent, theimplications and social purpose of the works of literaturethemselves.Lastly, there are the problems of the audience and theactual socialinfluence of literature. The question how far literature isactuallydetermined by or dependent on its social setting, on socialchange anddevelopment, is one which, in one way or another, will enterinto all thethree divisions of our problem: the sociology of the writer,the socialcontent of the works themselves, and the influence ofliterature onsociety. We shall have to decide what is meant by dependenceor causation;and ultimately we shall arrive at the problem of culturalintegrationand specifically at how our own culture is integrated.</p>
        <p>Since every writer is a member of society, he can be studiedas asocial being. Though his biography is the main source, sucha study caneasily widen into one of the whole milieu from which he cameand inwhich he lived. It will be possible to accumulate informationabout thesocial provenance, the family background, the economicposition ofwriters. We can show what was the exact share ofaristocrats, bourgeois,and proletarians in the history of literature; for example,we can demonstratethe predominant share which the children of the professionalandcommercial classes take in the production of Americanliterature.5Statistics can establish that, in modern Europe, literaturerecruited itspractitioners largely from the middle classes, sincearistocracy was preoccupiedwith the pursuit of glory or leisure while the lower classeshadlittle opportunity for education. In England, thisgeneralization holdsgood only with large reservations. The sons of peasants andworkmenappear infrequently in older English literature: exceptionssuch asBurns and Carlyle are partly explicable by reference to thedemocraticScottish school system. The role of the aristocracy inEnglish literaturewas uncommonly great - partly because it was less cut offfrom theprofessional classes than in other countries, where therewas no primogeniture.But, with a few exceptions, all modern Russian writersbeforeGoncharov and Chekhov were aristocratic in origin. EvenDostoyevskywas technically a nobleman, though his father, a doctor in aMoscowHospital for the Poor, acquired land and serfs only late inhis life.</p>
        <p>It is easy enough to collect such data but harder tointerpret them.Does social provenance prescribe social ideology andallegiance? Thecases of Shelley, Carlyle, and Tolstoy are obvious examplesof such‘ treason* to one’s class. Outside of Russia, most Communistwritersare not proletarian in origin. Soviet and other Marxistcritics havecarried out extensive investigations to ascertain preciselyboth theexact social provenance and the social allegiance of Russianwriters.Thus P. N. Sakulin bases his treatment of recent Russianliterature oncareful distinctions between the respective literatures ofthe peasants,the small <em class="notranslate" translate="no">bourgeoisie</em>, the democratic intelligentsia,the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">declasse</em> intelligentsia,the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">bourgeoisie,</em> the aristocracy, and therevolutionary proletariat.6 In the study of older literature, Russian scholars attemptelaboratedistinctions between the many groups and sub-groups of theRussian aristocracy to whom Pushkin and Gogol, Turgenev andTolstoymay be shown to have belonged by virtue of their inheritedwealthand early associations.7 But it is difficult to prove thatPushkin representedthe interests of the impoverished landed nobility and Gogolthose of the Ukrainian small landholder; such a conclusionis indeeddisproved by the general ideology of their works and by theappealthe works have made beyond the confines of a group, a class,and atime.8</p>
        <p>The social origins of a writer play only a minor part in thequestionsraised by his social status, allegiance, and ideology; forwriters, it isclear, have often put themselves at the service of anotherclass. Mostcourt poetry was written by men who, though born in lowerestate,adopted the ideology and taste of their patrons.</p>
        <p>The social allegiance, attitude, and ideology of a writercan bestudied not only in his writings but also, frequendy, inbiographicalextra-literary documents. The writer has been a citizen, haspronouncedon questions of social and political importance, has takenpart in theissues of his time.</p>
        <p>Much work has been done upon political and social views ofindividualwriters; and in recent times more and more attention hasbeendevoted to the economic implications of these views. Thus L.C.Knights, arguing that Ben Jonson’s economic attitude wasprofoundlymedieval, shows how, like several of his fellow dramatists,he satirizedthe rising class of usurers, monopolists, speculators, and ‘undertakers’.9Many works of literature - e.g. the ‘ histories’ ofShakespeare andSwift’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Gulliver*s Travels -</em> have been reinterpretedin close relation tothe political context of the time.10 Pronouncements,decisions, andactivities should never be confused with the actual socialimplicationsof a writer’s works. Balzac is a striking example of thepossible division;for, though his professed sympathies were all with the oldorder, thearistocracy, and the Church, his instinct and imaginationwere far moreengaged by the acquisitive type, the speculator, the newstrong man ofthe <em class="notranslate" translate="no">bourgeoisie</em>. There may be a considerabledifference between theoryand practice, between profession of faith and creativeability.</p>
        <p>These problems of social origins, allegiance, and ideologywill, ifsystematized, lead to a sociology of the writer as a type,or as a type at aparticular time and place. We can distinguish betweenwriters accordingto their degree of integration into the social process. Itis very close inpopular literature, but may reach the extremes ofdissociation, of‘ social distance’, in Bohemianism, with the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">poeiernaudit</em> and the freecreative genius. On the whole, in modern times, and in theWest, theliterary man seems to have lessened his class ties. Therehas arisen an‘ intelligentsia’, a comparatively independent in-betweenclass of professionals.It will be the task of literary sociology to trace its exactsocial status, its degree of dependence on the ruling class,the exacteconomic source of its support, the prestige of the writerin eachsociety.</p>
        <p>The general outlines of this history are already fairlyclear. In popularoral literature, we can study the role of the singer ornarrator who willdepend closely on the favour of his public: the bard inancient Greece,the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">scop</em> in Teutonic antiquity, the professionalfolk-tale teller in theOrient and Russia. In the ancient Greek city-state, thetragedians andsuch composers of dithyrambs and hymns as Pindar had theirspecial,semi-religious position, one slowly becoming moresecularized, as wecan see when we compare Euripides with Aeschylus. Among thecourtsof the Roman Empire, we must think of Virgil, Horace, andOvid asdependent on the bounty and goodwill of Augustus andMaecenas.</p>
        <p>In the Middle Ages, there are the monk in his cell, thetroubadourand <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Mimesanger</em> at the court or baron’s castle, thevagrant scholars onthe roads. The writer is either a clerk or scholar, or he isa singer, anentertainer, a minstrel. But even kings like Wenceslaus IIof Bohemiaor James I of Scodand are now poets - amateurs, dilettantes.In theGerman <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Meisiersangt</em> artisans are organized in poeticguilds, burgherswho practise poetry as a craft. With the Renaissance therearose a comparativelyunattached group of writers, the Humanists, who wanderedsometimes from country to country and offered their servicesto differentpatrons. Petrarch is the first modern <em class="notranslate" translate="no">poeta laureatus</em>,possessed of agrandiose conception of his mission, while Aretino is theprototype ofthe literary journalist, living on blackmail, feared ratherthan honouredand respected.</p>
        <p>In the large, the later history is the transition fromsupport by nobleor ignoble patrons to that afforded by publishers acting aspredictiveagents of the reading public. The system of aristocratic patronagewasnot, however, universal. The Church and, soon, the theatresupportedspecial types of literature. In England, the patronagesystem apparentlybegan to fail early in the eighteenth century. For a time,literature,deprived of its earlier benefactors and not yet fullysupported by thereading public, was economically worse off. The early lifeof Dr Johnsonin Grub Street and his defiance of Lord Chesterfieldsymbolize thesechanges. Yet a generation earlier, Pope was able to amass afortunefrom his translation of Homer, lavishly subscribed bynobility anduniversity men.</p>
        <p>The great financial rewards, however, came only in thenineteenthcentury, when Scott and Byron wielded an enormous influenceupontaste and public opinion. Voltaire and Goethe had vasdyincreased theprestige and independence of the writer on the Continent.The growthof the reading public, the founding of the great reviewslike the<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Edinburgh</em> and the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Quarterly</em>, made literaturemore and more the almostindependent ‘ institution* which Prosper de Barante, writingin 1822,claimed it to have been in the eighteenth century.11</p>
        <p>As Ashley Thorndike urged, the</p>
        <p><strong>outstanding characteristic o f the printed matter of thenineteenth century is not its vulgarization, or its mediocrity, but rather itsspecialization. This printed matter is no longer addressed to a uniform orhomogeneous public: it is divided up among many publics and consequentlydivided by many subjects, interests, and purposes.12</p>
        <p></strong>In <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Fiction and the Reading Public</em>, which might wellbe considered ahomily on Thorndike’s text, Q. D. Leavis13 points out thatthe eighteenth-century peasant who learned to read had to read what thegentryand the university men read; that the nineteenth-centuryreaders, on theother hand, are properly spoken of not as ‘ the public* butas ‘ publics’.Our own time knows still further multiplications inpublishing listsand magazine racks: there exist books for 9 to io-year-olds,books forboys of high-school age, books for those who ‘ live alone’ ;tradejournals, house organs, Sunday-school weeklies, Westerns,true-storyromances. Publishers, magazines, and writers all specialize.</p>
        <p>Thus a study of the economic basis of literature and of thesocialstatus of the writer is inextricably bound up with a studyof the audiencehe addresses and upon which he is dependent financially.14Even thearistocratic patron is an audience and frequently anexacting audience,requiring not only personal adulation but also conformity totheconventions of his class. In even earlier society, in thegroup where folkpoetryflourishes, the dependence of the author on the audience isevengreater: his work will not be transmitted unless it pleasesimmediately.The role of the audience in the theatre is, at least, astangible. Therehave been even attempts to trace the changes inShakespeare’s periodsand style to the change in the audience between the open-airGlobe, onthe South Bank, with its mixed audience, and Blackfriars, aclosed hallfrequented by the higher classes. It becomes harder to tracethe specificrelation between author and public at a later time when thereadingpublic rapidly expands, becomes dispersed and heterogeneous,andwhen the relationships of author and public grow moreindirect andoblique. The number of intermediaries between writers andthe publicincreases. We can study the role of such social institutionsand associationsas the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">salon</em>, the cafe, the club, the academy, andthe university.We can trace the history of reviews and magazines as well asof publishinghouses. The critic becomes an important middle-man; a groupofconnoisseurs, bibliophiles, and collectors may supportcertain kinds ofliterature; and the associations of literary men themselvesmay help tocreate a special public of writers or would-be writers. InAmericaespecially, women who (according to Veblen) providevicarious leisureand consumption of the arts for the tired businessman havebecomeactive determinants of literary taste.</p>
        <p>Still, the old patterns have not been completely replaced.All moderngovernments support and foster literature in variousdegrees; andpatronage means, of course, control and supervision.15 Tooverrate theconscious influence of the totalitarian state during thelast decadeswould be difficult. It has been both negative - insuppression, bookburning,censorship, silencing, and reprimanding, and positive - intheencouragement of ‘ blood and soil’ regionalism or Soviet ‘socialistrealism*. The fact that the state has been unsuccessful increating aliterature which, conforming to ideological specifications,is still greatart, cannot refute the view that government regulation ofliterature iseffective in offering the possibilities of creation to thosewho identifythemselves voluntarily or reluctantly with the officialprescriptions.Thus, in Soviet Russia, literature is at least in theoryagain becoming acommunal art and the artist has again been integrated intosociety.</p>
        <p>The graph of a book’s success, survival, and recrudescence,or awriter’s reputation and fame is mainly a social phenomenon.In part itbelongs, of course, to literary ‘ history’, since fame andreputation aremeasured by the actual influence of a writer on otherwriters, his generalpower of transforming and changing the literary tradition.In part,reputation is a matter of critical response: till now, ithas been tracedchiefly on the basis of more or less formal pronouncementsassumedto be representative of a period’s ‘ general reader’. Hence,while thewhole question of the ‘whirligig of taste’ is ‘ social’, itcan be put ona more definitely sociological basis: detailed work caninvestigatethe actual concordance between a work and the specificpublic whichhas made its success; evidence can be accumulated oneditions, copiessold.</p>
        <p>The stratification of every society is reflected in thestratification ofits taste. While the norms of the upper classes usuallydescend to thelower, the movement is sometimes reversed: interest infolklore andprimitive art is a case in point. There is no necessaryconcurrence betweenpolitical and social advancement and aesthetic: leadershipinliterature had passed to the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">bourgeoisie</em> long beforepolitical supremacy.Social stratification may be interfered with and evenabrogated inquestions of taste by differences of age and sex, byspecific groups andassociations. Fashion is also an important phenomenon inmodernliterature, for in a competitive fluid society, the norms ofthe upperclasses, quickly imitated, are in constant need ofreplacement. Certainlythe present rapid changes of taste seem to reflect the rapidsocial changesof the last decades and the general loose relation betweenartist andaudience.</p>
        <p>The modern writer’s isolation from society, illustrated byGrubStreet, Bohemia, Greenwich Village, the American expatriate,invitessociological study. A Russian socialist, Georgi Plekhanov,believes thatthe doctrine o f ‘ art for art’s sake’ develops when artistsfeel a</p>
        <p><strong>hopeless contradiction between their aims and the aims ofthe society to which they belong. Artists must be very hostile to theirsociety and they must sec no hope of changing it.1«</p>
        <p></strong>In his <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sociology of 'Literary Tastey</em> Levin L.Schiicking has sketched outsome of these problems; elsewhere, he has studied in detailthe role ofthe family and women as an audience in the eighteenthcentury.17Though much evidence has been accumulated,well-substantiatedconclusions have rarely been drawn concerning the exactrelationsbetween the production of literature and its economicfoundations, oreven concerning the exact influence of the public on awriter. Therelationship is obviously not one of mere dependence or of passivecompliancewith the prescriptions of patron or public. Writers maysucceedin creating their own special public; indeed, as Coleridgeknew, everynew writer has to create the taste which will enjoy him.</p>
        <p>The writer is not only influenced by society: he influencesit. Art notmerely reproduces life but also shapes it. People may modeltheir livesupon the patterns of fictional heroes and heroines. Theyhave made love,committed crimes and suicide according to the book, be itGoethe’s<em class="notranslate" translate="no">Sorrows of Wertber</em> or Dumas’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Musketeers.</em> Butcan we precisely definethe influence of a book on its readers? Will it ever bepossible to describethe influence of satire? Did Addison really change themanners ofhis society or Dickens incite reforms of debtors’ prisons,boys’ schools,and poorhouses?18 Was Harriet Beecher Stowe really the ‘little womanwho made the great war’ ? Has <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Gone with the Wind</em> changedNorthernreaders’ attitudes towards Mrs Stowe’s war? How haveHemingwayand Faulkner affected their readers? How great was theinfluence ofliterature on the rise of modern nationalism? Certainly thehistoricalnovels of Walter Scott in Scotland, of Henryk Sienkiewicz inPoland, ofAlois Jirasek in Czechoslovakia, have done something verydefinite toincrease national pride and a common memory of historicalevents.</p>
        <p>We can hypothesize - plausibly, no doubt - that the youngare moredirectly and powerfully influenced by their reading than theold, thatinexperienced readers take literature more naively astranscript ratherthan interpretation of life, that those whose books are fewtake them inmore utter seriousness than do wide and professionalreaders. Can weadvance beyond such conjecture? Can we make use ofquestionnairesand any other mode of sociological inquiry? No exactobjectivity isobtainable, for the attempt at case histories will dependupon thememories and the analytic powers of the interrogated, andtheir testimonieswill need codification and evaluation by a fallible mind.But thequestion, ‘How does literature affect its audience?’ is anempirical one,to be answered, if at all, by the appeal to experience; and,since we arethinking of literature in the broadest sense, and society inthe broadest,the appeal must be made to the experience not of the connoisseuralonebut to that of the human race. We have scarcely begun tostudy suchquestions.19</p>
        <p>Much the most common approach to the relations of literatureandsociety is the study of works of literature as socialdocuments, asassumed pictures of social reality. Nor can it be doubtedthat some kindof social picture can be abstracted from literature. Indeed,this has beenone of the earliest uses to which literature has been put bysystematicstudents. Thomas Warton, the first real historian of Englishpoetry,argued that literature has the ‘ peculiar merit offaithfully recording thefeatures of the times, and of preserving the mostpicturesque and expressiverepresentation of manners’ ;20 and to him and many of hisantiquarian successors, literature was primarily a treasuryof costumesand customs, a source book for the history of civilization,especially ofchivalry and its decline. As for modern readers, many ofthem derivetheir chief impressions of foreign societies from the readingof novels,from Sinclair Lewis and Galsworthy, from Balzac andTurgenev.</p>
        <p>Used as a social document, literature can be made to yieldthe outlinesof social history. Chaucer and Langland preserve two viewsof fourteenth-century society. The Prologue to the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Canterbury Tales</em> wasearlyseen to offer an almost complete survey of social types.Shakespeare, inthe <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Merry Wives of Windsor</em>, Ben Jonson in severalplays, and ThomasDeloney seem to tell us something about the Elizabethanmiddle class.Addison, Fielding, and Smollett depict the new <em class="notranslate" translate="no">bourgeoisie</em>of theeighteenth century; Jane Austen, the country gentry andcountry parsonsearly in the nineteenth century; and Trollope, Thackeray,andDickens, the Victorian world. At the turn of the century,Galsworthyshows us the English upper middle classes; Wells, the lowermiddleclasses; Bennett, the provincial towns.</p>
        <p>A similar series of social pictures could be assembled forAmericanlife from the novels of Harriet Beecher Stowe and Howells tothose ofFarrell and Steinbeck. The life of post-Restoration Parisand Franceseems preserved in the hundreds of characters moving throughthepages of Balzac’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Human Comedy</em>; and Proust traced inendless detail thesocial stratifications of the decaying French aristocracy.The Russiaof the nineteenth-century landowners appears in the novelsof Turgenevand Tolstoy; we have glimpses of the merchant and theintellectual inChekhov’s stories and plays and of collectivized farmers inSholokhov.</p>
        <p>Examples could be multiplied indefinitely. One can assembleandexposit the ‘world’ of each, the part each gives to love andmarriage,to business, to the professions, its delineation ofclergymen, whetherstupid or clever, saintly or hypocritical; or one canspecialize upon JaneAusten’s naval men, Proust’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">arrivistes</em>, Howells’smarried women. Thiskind of specialization will offer us monographs on the‘Relation betweenLandlord and Tenant in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction’,‘ The Sailor in English Fiction and Drama’, or ‘ Irish-AmericansinTwentieth-Century Fiction’.</p>
        <p>But such studies seem of little value so long as they takeit forgranted that literature is simply a mirror of life, areproduction, andthus, obviously, a social document. Such studies make senseonly if weknow the artistic method of the novelist studied, and cansay - notmerely in general terms, but concretely - in what relationthe picturestands to the social reality. Is it realistic by intention?Or is it, at certainpoints, satire, caricature, or romantic idealization? In anadmirablyclear-headed study of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Aristocracy and the Middle Classesin Germany</em>,Kohn-Bramstedt rightly cautions us:</p>
        <p>Only a person who has a knowledge of the structure of asociety from othersources than purely literary ones is able to find out if,and how far, certainsocial types and their behaviour are reproduced in thenovel. . . . What ispure fancy, what realistic observation, and what only anexpression of thedesires of the author must be separated in each case in asubtle manner.21</p>
        <p>Using Max Weber’s conception of ideal ‘ social types’, thesamescholar studies such social phenomena as class hatred, thebehaviour ofthe parvenu, snobbery, and the attitude towards the Jews; andhe arguesthat such phenomena are not so much objective facts andbehaviourpatterns as they are complex attitudes, thus far betterillustrated infiction than elsewhere. Students of social attitudes andaspirations canuse literary material, if they know how to interpret itproperly. Indeed,for older periods, they will be forced to use literary or atleast semiliterarymaterial for want of evidence from the sociologists of thetime:writers on politics, economics, and general publicquestions.</p>
        <p>Heroes and heroines of fiction, villains and adventuresses,affordinteresting indications of such social attitudes.22 Suchstudies constantlylead into the history of ethical and religious ideas. Weknow the medievalstatus of the traitor and the medieval attitude towardsusury,which, lingering on into the Renaissance, gives us Shylockand, later,Moliere’s <em class="notranslate" translate="no">L'Avare.</em> To which ‘ deadly sin’ have latercenturies chieflyassigned the villain; and is his villainy conceived of interms of personalor social morality? Is he, for example, artist at rape orembezzler ofwidows* bonds?</p>
        <p>The classic case is that of Restoration English comedy. Wasit simplya realm of cuckoldom, a fairyland of adulteries and mockmarriages asLamb believed? Or was it, as Macaulay would have us believe,a faithfulpicture of decadent, frivolous, and brutal aristocracy?23 Orshould wenot rather, rejecting both alternatives, see what particularsocial groupcreated this art for what audience? And should we not seewhether itwas a naturalistic or a stylized art? Should we not bemindful of satireand irony, self-ridicule and fantasy? Like all literature,these plays arenot simply documents; they are plays with stock figures,stock situations,with stage marriages and stage conditions of marriagesettlements.E. E. Stoll concludes his many arguments on these matters:</p>
        <p>Evidently this is not a ‘ real society’, not a faithfulpicture even of the‘ fashionable life’ : evidently it is not England, even ‘under the Stuarts’,whether since or before the Revolution or the GreatRebellion.24</p>
        <p>Still, the salutary emphasis upon convention and traditionto be foundin writing like Stoll’s cannot completely discharge therelations betweenliterature and society. Even the most abstruse allegory, themost unrealpastoral, the most outrageous farce can, properlyinterrogated, tell ussomething of the society of a time.</p>
        <p>Literature occurs only in a social context, as part of aculture, in amilieu. Taine’s famous triad of <em class="notranslate" translate="no">race, milieu</em>, and <em class="notranslate" translate="no">moment</em>has, in practice,led to an exclusive study of the milieu. Race is an unknownfixed integralwith which Taine operates very loosely. It is often simplythe assumed‘ national character’ or the English or French ‘ spirit’. <em class="notranslate" translate="no">Moment</em>can bedissolved into the concept of milieu. A difference of timemeans simplya different setting, but the actual question of analysisarises only if wetry to break up the term ‘ milieu The most immediate settingof a workof literature, we shall then recognize, is its linguisticand literary tradition,and this tradition in turn is encompassed by a generalcultural‘ climate’. Only far less directly can literature beconnected with concreteeconomic, political, and social situations. Of course thereareinterrelationships between all spheres of human activities.Eventuallywe can establish some connexion between the modes ofproduction andliterature, since an economic system usually implies somesystem ofpower and must control the forms of family life. And the familyplaysan important role in education, in the concepts of sexualityand love, inthe whole convention and tradition of human sentiment. Thusit ispossible to link even lyric poetry with love conventions,religious preconceptions,and conceptions of nature. But these relationships may bedevious and oblique.</p>
        <p>It seems impossible, however, to accept a view constitutingany particularhuman activity the ‘ starter’ of all the others, whether itbe thetheory of Taine, who explains human creation by acombination ofclimatic, biological, and social factors, or that of Hegeland the Hegelians,who consider ‘ spirit’ the only moving force in history, orthat ofthe Marxists, who derive everything from the modes ofproduction. Noradical technological changes took place in the manycenturies betweenthe early Middle Ages and the rise of capitalism, whilecultural life, andliterature in particular, underwent most profoundtransformations. Nordoes literature always show, at least immediately, muchawareness of anepoch’s technological changes: the Industrial RevolutionpenetratedEnglish novels only in the forties of the nineteenth century(withElizabeth Gaskell, Kingsley, and Charlotte Bronte), longafter its symptomswere plainly visible to economists and social thinkers.</p>
        <p>The social situation, one should admit, seems to determinethe possibilityof the realization of certain aesthetic values, but not thevaluesthemselves. We can determine in general outlines what artforms arepossible in a given society and which are impossible, but itis not possibleto predict that these art forms will actually come intoexistence.Many Marxists - and not Marxists only - attempt far toocrude shortcuts from economics to literature. For example, John MaynardKeynes,not an unliterary person, has ascribed the existence ofShakespeare tothe fact that</p>
        <p>we were just in a financial position to afford Shakespeareat the momentwhen he presented himself. Great writers flourished in theatmosphere ofbuoyancy, exhilaration, and the freedom of economic caresfelt by the governingclass, which is engendered by profit inflations.25</p>
        <p>But profit inflations did not elicit great poets elsewhere -for instance,during the boom of the twenties in the United States - noris this viewof the optimistic Shakespeare quite beyond dispute. No morehelpful isthe opposite formula, devised by a Russian Marxist:</p>
        <p>Shakespeare’s tragic outlook on the world was consequentialupon hisbeing the dramatic expression of the feudal aristocracy,which in Elizabeth’sday had lost their former dominant position. 26</p>
        <p>Such contradictory judgements, attached to vague categorieslikeoptimism and pessimism, fail to deal concretely with eitherthe ascertainablesocial content of Shakespeare’s plays, his professedopinions onpolitical questions (obvious from the chronicle plays), orhis socialstatus as a writer.</p>
        <p>One must be careful, however, not to dismiss the economicapproachto literature by means of such quotations. Marx himself,thoughon occasion he made some fanciful judgements, in generalacutelyperceived the obliqueness of the relationship betweenliterature andsociety. In the Introduction to <em class="notranslate" translate="no">The Critique of PoliticalEconowj</em>, headmits that</p>
        <p>certain periods of highest development of art stand in nodirect relation withthe general development of society, nor with the materialbasis and theskeleton structure of its organization. Witness the exampleof the Greeks ascompared with the modern nations or even Shakespeare. 27</p>
        <p>He also understood that the modern division of labour leadsto a definitecontradiction between the three factors (‘moments’ in hisHegelianterminology) of the social process - ‘ productive forces’, ‘social relations’,and ‘ consciousness’. He expected, in a manner whichscarcelyseems to avoid the Utopian, that in the future classlesssociety thesedivisions of labour would again disappear, that the artistwould again beintegrated into society. He thought it possible thateverybody could bean excellent, even an original, painter. ‘ In a communistsociety therewill not be any painters, but at most men who, among otherthings, alsopaint.’28</p>
        <p>The ‘ vulgar Marxist’ tells us that this or that writer wasa bourgeoiswho voiced reactionary or progressive opinions about ChurchandState. There is a curious contradiction between this avoweddeterminismwhich assumes that ‘ consciousness’ must follow ‘existence’, that abourgeois cannot help being one, and the usual ethicaljudgement whichcondemns him for these very opinions. In Russia, one notes,writers ofbourgeois origin who have joined the proletariat haveconstantly beensubjected to suspicions of their sincerity, and everyartistic or civic failinghas been ascribed to their class origin. Yet if progress, inthe Marxistsense, leads directly from feudalism via bourgeoiscapitalism to the‘ dictatorship of the proletariat ’, it would be logical andconsistent for aMarxist to praise the ‘ progressives’ at any time. He shouldpraise thebourgeois when, in the early stages of capitalism, he foughtthe survivingfeudalism. But frequently Marxists criticize writers from atwentiethcenturypoint of view, or, like Smirnov and Grib, Marxists verycriticalof ‘ vulgar sociology ’, rescue the bourgeois writer by arecognition of hisuniversal humanity. Thus Smirnov comes to the conclusionthat Shakespearewas the ‘ humanist ideologist of the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">bourgeoisie</em>, theexponent of theprogramme advanced by them when, in the name of humanity,theyfirst challenged the feudal order’.29 But the concept ofhumanism, of theuniversality of art, surrenders the central doctrine ofMarxism, which isessentially relativistic.</p>
        <p>Marxist criticism is at its best when it exposes the impliedrlatent,social implications of a writer’s work. In this respect itis a technique ofinterpretation parallel to those founded upon the insightsof Freud, orof Nietzsche, or of Pareto, or to the Scheler-Mannheim ‘sociology ofknowledge’. All these intellectuals are suspicious of theintellect, theprofessed doctrine, the mere statement. The centraldistinction is thatNietzsche’s and Freud’s methods are psychological, whilePareto’sanalysis o f ‘ residues’ and ‘ derivatives’ and theScheler-Mannheim techniqueof the analysis of ‘ ideology’ are sociological.</p>
        <p>The ‘ sociology of knowledge’, as illustrated in thewritings of MaxScheler, Max Weber, and Karl Mannheim, has been worked outindetail and has some definite advantages over its rivals.30It not onlydraws attention to the presuppositions and implications of agiven ideologicalposition, but it also stresses the hidden assumptions andbiases ofthe investigator himself. It is thus self-critical andself-conscious, evento the extreme of morbidity. It is also less prone thaneither Marxism orpsychoanalysis to isolate one single factor as the soledeterminant ofchange. Whatever their failure at isolating the religiousfactor, thestudies of Max Weber in the sociology of religion arevaluable for theirattempt to describe the influence of ideological factors oneconomic behaviourand institutions - for earlier emphasis had been entirelyuponthe economic influence on ideology.31 A similarinvestigation of theinfluences of literature on social change would be verywelcome, thoughit would run into analogous difficulties. It seems as hardto isolate thestrictly literary factor as the religious factor and toanswer the questionwhether the influence is due to the particular factoritself, or to otherforces for which the factor is a mere ‘ shrine’ or ‘channel*.32</p>
        <p>The ‘ sociology of knowledge’ suffers, however, from itsexcessivehistoricism; it has come to ultimately sceptical conclusionsdespite itsthesis that ‘ objectivity* can be achieved by synthesizing,and thusneutralizing, the conflicting perspectives. It suffers also,in applicationto literature, from its inability to connect ‘ content’ with‘ form’. LikeMarxism, preoccupied with an irrationalistic explanation, itis unable toprovide a rational foundation for aesthetics and hencecriticism andevaluation. This is, of course, true of all extrinsicapproaches to literature.No causal study can do justice to the analysis, description,andevaluation of a literary work.</p>
        <p>But the problem of ‘ literature and society’ can obviouslybe put indifferent terms, those of symbolic or meaningful relations:of consistency,harmony, coherence, congruence, structural identity,stylisticanalogy, or with whatever term we want to designate the integrationofa culture and the interrelationship among the differentactivities of men.Sorokin, who has analysed the various possibilitiesclearly,33 has concludedthat the degree of integration varies from society tosociety.</p>
        <p>Marxism never answers the question of the degree ofdependence ofliterature on society. Hence many of the basic problems havescarcelybegun to be studied. Occasionally, for example, one seesarguments forthe social determination of genres, as in the case of thebourgeois originof the novel, or even the details of their attitudes andforms, as in E. B.Burgum’s not very convincing view that tragi-comedy ‘results from theimprint of middle-class seriousness upon aristocraticfrivolity’.34 Arethere definite social determinants of such a broad literarystyle as Romanticism,which, though associated with the <em class="notranslate" translate="no">bourgeoisie></em> wasantibourgeoisin its ideology, at least in Germany, from its verybeginning ?35Though some kind of dependence of literary ideologies andthemes onsocial circumstances seems obvious, the social origins offorms andstyles, genres and actual literary norms have rarely beenestablished.</p>
        <p>It has been attempted most concretely in studies of thesocial originsof literature: in Bucher’s one-sided theory of the rise ofpoetry fromlabour rhythms; in the many studies by anthropologists ofthe magicrole of early art; in George Thomson’s very learned attemptto bringGreek tragedy into concrete relations with cult and ritualsand with adefinite democratic social revolution at the time ofAeschylus; in ChristopherCauldwell’s somewhat naive attempt to study the sources ofpoetry in tribal emotions and in the bourgeois ‘ illusion’of individualfreedom.36</p>
        <p>Only if the social determination of forms could be shownconclusivelycould the question be raised whether social attitudes cannotbecome‘ constitutive’ and enter a work of art as effective partsof its artisticvalue. One can argue that ‘ social truth’, while not, assuch, an artisticvalue, corroborates such artistic values as complexity andcoherence.But it need not be so. There is great literature which haslittle or nosocial relevance; social literature is only one kind ofliterature and is notcentral in the theory of literature unless one holds theview that literatureis primarily an ‘ imitation’ of life as it is and of sociallife in particular.But literature is no substitute for sociology or politics.It has its ownjustification and aim.</p>
